    <p> Dear reader, first of all, thank you for having some time from your busy schedule to visit my blog. </p>

        This is something I wanted to have from my university days over there in Santiniketan (2010-2015). The main motivation came when I started 
        learning something different from regular courses in Statistics, one day I got impressed by seeing a research paper written by one of 
        my professors and his scholar, with curiosity I asked them about the method of developing a paper full of complex mathematical equations and 
        the reply came to me as <a href="www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. I googled it and found it to be 'the' best way to typeset a 
        technical document. Over the time, I learnt a little bit of it and developed my first project - <i>'Digitization of hand written course notes'</i>. 
        It took me around three months to complete the project and finally I got a nicely typed document.

        At the same time I was also learrning R Programming and it suddenly came to mind that how it would be if I could create a simple blog for R 
        containing the recipes that I was learning, but the material had to be written in Bengali instead of English, so that people who were not having 
        good grasp in English but at the same time having a keen interest in Statistics and R, could learn something with flexibility. You know one thing, 
        learning in your mother tongue has always a very different taste. It was 2013, when I learnt HTML and created my first blog with some of the basic R recipes 
        written entirely in Bengali, I agree that it doesn't make sense to mention that over here, but that was a great start. It is still available 
        <a href="http://koushik1992.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2016-04-02T01:42:00-07:00&max-results=7">here</a> but not maintained regularly.

        Now a days, as a data science professional, I learn so many things while working on the practicle industrial problems. This blog will borrow 
        some of my practical experiences which may be useful for you as well. My aim is to write articles (obviously this time not in Bengali) on 
        data mining methodologies with simple analogies. I thought of writing such articles on popular platform like Medium, but the main problem is to integrate 
        a typesetting engine like LaTeX to produce good looking mathematical expressions, but platform like GitHub Pages can easily be integrated with 
        <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> (a javascript library to write math in HTML) to produce any type of mathematical expressions 
        and also it is free.

        Before I come to a closure, this is to let you know that there will be a comment section at the end of each article. Please feel free to add your
        valuable feedback for me.

        Thanks again!
